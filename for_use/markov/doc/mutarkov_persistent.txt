This version includes:

Mutation & noise injection via entropy_pressure

Risk of irreversible collapse via fragility

Recovery behavior & structural preservation via reversibility and slack

Word-slot based generation with some occasional randomness-shuffling

Drug insertions for semantic chaos!

Self-adapting entropy & reversibility over time to simulate resilience vs collapse
