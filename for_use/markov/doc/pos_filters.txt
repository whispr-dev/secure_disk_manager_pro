ðŸ§  How POS (Part-of-Speech) Filters Work
POS filtering is about tagging each word with its grammatical role:

NOUN: people, places, things (dog, freedom)

VERB: actions or states (run, exist)

ADJ: modifiers (blue, strange)

ADV: modifies verbs/adjectives (quickly, very)

DET: determiners (the, a, this)

PREP: prepositions (on, between)

PRON: pronouns (she, they)

etc.

Typical Workflow:
Tokenize the sentence (split into words).

Tag each token using a POS tagger (like SpaCy, NLTK, Stanza, or nltk.pos_tag() in Python).

Filter or transform based on tag type.
