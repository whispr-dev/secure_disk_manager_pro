- where they report back to if anywhere;
- generally, wtf are they all about 'n sould i be scaer?

ChatGPT said:
Thanks for sharing the files, fren. Just before I kick off the deep research, could you please clarify a few things for me:

Do you know what site these scripts came from (or are still live on)?

Are you trying to attribute them for security analysis (e.g., malware or spyware profiling), legal context (e.g., identifying fraud/scam activity), or something else?

What’s your threat model — are you trying to protect a single dev machine, a corporate infra, a privacy toolchain, or just curious as hell?

Should I prioritize threat intel sources (e.g., abuse.ch, VirusTotal, security blogs) or stick to open web searches and static code analysis?

This will help me tailor the research for max precision and paranoia-appropriateness.

Threat Analysis of Suspicious JavaScript Files

Executive Summary
A collection of JavaScript files was found embedded in a fraudulent “background check” website. Our analysis reveals that these scripts are not custom malware but rather third-party tracking and anti-fraud libraries. They appear to be used for user analytics, fingerprinting, and conversion tracking, likely to monitor visitors and maximize the scam’s profits. Specifically, we identified scripts from Impact’s affiliate tracking platform, a fingerprinting/analytics service (segreencolumn.com), the MetaMask extension’s sandbox code, Pinterest’s advertising tag, and Sift Science’s fraud detection toolkit. While none of the files execute overtly malicious payloads, they aggressively collect data (device fingerprints, behavior metrics, etc.) and send it to external endpoints. This poses privacy risks and could aid the scammers in identifying or profiling victims. In a security triage context, these scripts should be treated with caution – they should be run in a sandboxed environment to observe their behavior, and their known network endpoints can be flagged for monitoring. Below, we detail each file’s functionality, possible attribution, and the threat/risk it represents, followed by indicators of compromise and recommendations for handling.
File-by-File Technical Analysis
A3270977-ffaf-43de-877a-9d248d1649141.js – Impact “UTT” Affiliate Tracking
This script is part of Impact’s Universal Tracking Tag (UTT), a marketing/affiliate analytics library by Impact Tech (formerly Impact Radius). The code includes utility functions for URL parsing, cookie management, event listeners, and error logging. Notably, it sets cookies prefixed with IR_ (e.g. IR_gbd) to track users across domains and sessions
weber.com
. The script tries to determine the base domain and store an identifier (IR_PI cookie) for the user. It also specifically checks if the referrer is a payment site (keywords like “paypal”, “authorize”, etc.) – likely to attribute conversions properly. Any runtime errors in this tracker are reported via an image beacon to a Loggly logging endpoint with a unique customer token
file-4u6gqrpnzfn2udwvdj97dg
. For example, it calls:
https://logs-01.loggly.com/inputs/9b965af4-52fb-46fa-be1b-8dc5fb0aad05/tag/jsinsight/1*1.gif?...
file-4u6gqrpnzfn2udwvdj97dg
where it appends info like script version, acid (account ID) if available, event name, message, and the user agent. The presence of uttcdn: "utt.impactcdn.com" in the code confirms it’s tied to Impact’s CDN
file-4u6gqrpnzfn2udwvdj97dg
. In fact, utt.impactcdn.com is known to serve Impact’s tracking scripts and set cookies like IR_gbd for cross-site identification
weber.com
qualitycompanyformations.co.uk
. Purpose & Functionality: This UTT script’s purpose is affiliate marketing and conversion tracking. It logs when a user lands on the page, manages unique IDs for the user, and likely communicates conversions (e.g. if the user signs up or pays) back to Impact’s system for attribution. It gathers UTM parameters from the URL (campaign info), and can hash email addresses if provided (there’s an emailRegex and SHA-1 implementation present, possibly for hashing user emails to match conversions). All of this suggests the scammers were using a commercial affiliate/advertising tracker – possibly to credit themselves for traffic or to integrate with an affiliate program. Attribution: The code is maintained by Impact (impact.com); it’s a standard library used by many sites for partner marketing. The file name (a GUID-like ID) likely corresponds to a specific account’s tag. This means the scam site was using an Impact account – an attribution clue, as that account ID could be traced to an entity if law enforcement or Impact is engaged. Impact is not a threat group but a legit company; the abuse here is by the scam operators leveraging Impact’s tech. Risk: By itself, this script is not malicious to users’ devices. It does collect and send data (like cookies, user agent, referrer) to Impact’s servers and sets tracking cookies. In a scam context, it mainly breaches privacy. The biggest risk is if the script were subverted or if the data could be repurposed. We did not find evidence of it delivering malware. However, analysts should isolate this script during analysis to prevent it from phoning home. Its Loggly beacon in particular could potentially alert the scammers (if they monitor errors/events).
c6c44ac6ab89b928accfbf17b00aadc3.js – Segreencolumn Telemetry & Fingerprinting
This file is a heavily obfuscated Webpack bundle that implements an extensive telemetry and browser fingerprinting system. It immediately stood out for referencing the domain obs.segreencolumn.com as a data collection endpoint
file-vivbfbn87f69m5dznczvn4
. The script constructs calls to URLs like:
https://obs.segreencolumn.com/tracker/<ID>.gif?... (tracking pixel)
file-vivbfbn87f69m5dznczvn4
https://obs.segreencolumn.com/tracker/<ID>.html?... (possibly used to set/read cookies or localStorage via an invisible iframe)
file-vivbfbn87f69m5dznczvn4
https://obs.segreencolumn.com/ct?... (a main telemetry submission)
file-vivbfbn87f69m5dznczvn4
Data Collection: This script is quite invasive in the data it gathers. It hooks into browser events and properties to fingerprint the client’s environment:
It collects performance/timing metrics: The code iterates over performance.timing attributes (connect times, DOM load, etc.) and sends them out
file-vivbfbn87f69m5dznczvn4
.
Canvas/WebGL fingerprinting: The script creates an off-screen canvas or uses a Web Worker to perform drawing operations. In the code, we saw it posting a message containing image data to a Worker and then capturing a response, likely a hashed canvas fingerprint
file-vivbfbn87f69m5dznczvn4
. It labels this data with keys like "awgl" (possibly “canvas/WebGL”).
Browser features and behavior: It checks navigator.userAgentData (for high-entropy UA hints like architecture, model, platform)
file-jjpqk3rctayhvdn19uwgti
. It listens for the visibilitychange event to detect when the page is foregrounded (for the first time) – perhaps to record “time to first interaction” or ensure it only logs certain metrics once
file-vivbfbn87f69m5dznczvn4
. It may also track single-page app navigation (there are references to SPA in the code).
Randomization & obfuscation: Numerous functions (named like p.C, p.M, p.N etc.) generate random numbers, random IDs, and encode data. For instance, it has a custom base64 alphabet and uses encryption-like routines (perhaps to obfuscate the data it sends).
Exfiltration: All the collected info is serialized and sent as query parameters to the segreencolumn ct endpoint. The query includes many fields: we observed parameters for page URL, user ID, screen resolution (fs and fst values), timestamps (tsf etc.), user agent (ag), and possibly more
file-vivbfbn87f69m5dznczvn4
. The use of .gif requests indicates classic pixel tracking, and the .html endpoint suggests a method to circumvent third-party cookie restrictions by using an iframe (the iframe likely sets a cookie or local storage on the segreencolumn domain and communicates back). Purpose: The behavior aligns with session analytics or anti-bot detection. It is similar to scripts used by customer experience analytics (like session replay tools) or by fraud prevention services to fingerprint devices. Notably, segreencolumn.com is flagged in multiple threat intelligence and privacy sources as a tracker domain. For example, the EFF Privacy Badger project explicitly lists segreencolumn.com as a tracking domain to block
gist.github.com
, and AdGuard’s filter lists include it
badmojr.github.io
. Sandbox analyses of malware have also observed traffic to obs.segreencolumn.com, suggesting it often appears in suspicious/malicious site contexts
any.run
 (likely because it’s used on any site that implements this aggressive tracking, including fraudulent ones). It may be part of a commercial analytics platform; one theory is that it’s associated with Quantum Metric or a similar user-behavior analytics service, since network captures often see segreencolumn endpoints alongside Quantum Metric’s (quantummetric.com)
joesandbox.com
. However, the exact service could be something akin to a “stealth” analytics provider that uses generically named domains. The code doesn’t disclose a brand name, which is perhaps intentional. Attribution: Without an obvious vendor name in the script, attribution is a bit murky. The domain is registered through Amazon (AWS) and MarkMonitor, and has subdomains like euob.segreencolumn.com (perhaps EU region) – patterns that hint at a legitimate service with global nodes. One clue: the term “segreencolumn” and related domains (we found references to thisgreencolumn.com and withflowersea.com in tracker lists
blokada.org
) suggest an internal naming scheme. These could be first-party proxy domains for a larger analytics company trying to evade adblockers by cycling domains. There’s no indication this was written by a known threat group; it’s more likely authored by a marketing analytics or anti-fraud company. Threat & Risk: Technically, this script is not delivering malware, but it is highly intrusive. From a security perspective, it operates like spyware – fingerprinting the user and sending data to an external server without user consent. In the context of the scam site, this could help the scammers in multiple ways:
Identifying returning users or researchers: A sophisticated scammer could use the fingerprint to recognize if a certain device visits multiple times or has characteristics of a bot/script, and then deny access or show different content.
Conversion and performance tracking: They might be measuring how users navigate the fake site, where they drop off, etc., to optimize the fraud funnel.
Possible PII leakage: If any personal info was entered on the site, there’s a chance some could be picked up (though we did not explicitly see form scraping in this code, it mostly focuses on technical fingerprinting).
Handling: This script should absolutely be run in a sandboxed environment. Do not execute it on a host with real user data. Monitor all network calls to *.segreencolumn.com if you must run it. Many defenders may choose to block the segreencolumn domain enterprise-wide, as it has no business use except tracking. When investigating the site, treat any identifiers (like the query parameters or any cookies it sets) as IOCs – for example, a cookie or localStorage key might identify the victim’s session in the scammer’s telemetry. If available, those can sometimes be correlated with server-side logs.
lockdown-install.js & lockdown-run.js – MetaMask Extension Sandbox (Agoric SES)
These two files are a bit tangential: they are not part of the website’s code but rather injected by the MetaMask browser extension (if the analyst or user had MetaMask installed while visiting the site). They originate from the Secure ECMAScript (SES) “Lockdown” library by Agoric, which MetaMask uses to isolate untrusted scripts.
lockdown-install.js is a large script (≈2200 lines) that freezes JavaScript intrinsics and prototypes on the page. It systematically goes through global objects (Array, Object, Date, Promise, etc.) and “tames” or locks them down
file-q8r7r3a8rvhxp66pacpyrn
file-q8r7r3a8rvhxp66pacpyrn
. This is done to prevent any malicious scripts from modifying built-in prototypes (a common supply-chain attack) or leaking data. It’s essentially preparing a secure sandbox environment. The code uses internal markers like $h‍_once and $h‍_imports, which are specific to the SES framework (these ensure each intrinsic is recorded once)
file-q8r7r3a8rvhxp66pacpyrn
.
lockdown-run.js is a short initializer that actually invokes the lockdown() function with certain taming options
file-pq3gnzmfbduqrr3tfqy3f2
. It sets options such as consoleTaming: 'unsafe' (meaning console methods aren’t fully disabled) and others like errorTaming, dateTaming, etc., then calls lockdown()
file-pq3gnzmfbduqrr3tfqy3f2
. It also catches any exceptions and logs them (to console and to a Sentry error tracker if present)
file-pq3gnzmfbduqrr3tfqy3f2
. Notably, the comments mention “this affects Firefox v56 and Waterfox” and the code references a globalThis.sentry – these are identical to MetaMask’s content script error handling
file-pq3gnzmfbduqrr3tfqy3f2
.
Purpose: These scripts’ purpose is defensive – they are protecting the browser/extension, not attacking. MetaMask injects them into every web page as a precaution, so that if MetaMask later injects its own scripts or interacts with page scripts, the environment is confined. In our scenario, the presence of these files indicates the machine used to capture the site had MetaMask running. The malicious site itself did not deliver these files. Attribution: They are maintained by Consensys (MetaMask team) and Agoric. The filename lockdown-run.js and lockdown-more.js are well-known in MetaMask’s public source
github.com
, and the exact content matches the open-source SES library (even the variable naming and method order match MetaMask’s repository)
github.com
. This is confirmed by a MetaMask extension package on jsDelivr which lists lockdown-run.js as a component
cdn.jsdelivr.net
. Risk: No malicious behavior – these files do not collect data or harm the user. If anything, they reduce risk by neutralizing JavaScript prototypal tampering. For an investigator, the main risk is confusion: one might mistakenly think “lockdown” refers to ransomware or something – but here it’s benign. We include them for completeness, but they can largely be ignored in terms of threat triage. One should neither block nor remove them if using MetaMask, as they’re integral to extension security. If analyzing the site in a controlled environment, ideally do so without extensions to avoid extra noise like this.
main.b4887131.js – Pinterest Tag (Conversion Tracking Script)
This is a compiled script that contains the Pinterest Ads “Tag” code. It is responsible for tracking user page visits and actions for Pinterest’s advertising/analytics platform. The code defines a global pintrk function and processes a queue of tracking commands (pintrk.queue). We identified multiple hallmarks of the Pinterest tag in this file:
Network calls to Pinterest: It sends HTTP requests to https://ct.pinterest.com/ endpoints. For example, it uses an XHR POST to ct.pinterest.com/stats/
file-jjpqk3rctayhvdn19uwgti
 and creates an iframe pointing to ct.pinterest.com/ct.html (likely for setting cookies or enabling communication in a third-party context)
file-jjpqk3rctayhvdn19uwgti
. The code also listens for message events from that iframe (to receive data back, perhaps an identifier)
file-jjpqk3rctayhvdn19uwgti
file-jjpqk3rctayhvdn19uwgti
. These domains (ct.pinterest.com) are the official Pinterest conversion tracking endpoints used by their tag
stackoverflow.com
.
Advanced Matching (PII hashing): The script contains logic for “Enhanced Match”, which is a Pinterest feature to send hashed user data (like email, name, etc.) for better attribution. We see arrays aem_* (probably stands for “ads enhanced match”) – e.g., aem_fn, aem_ln for first name, last name; aem_ph for phone; aem_ct, aem_st, aem_zp for city, state, ZIP; and aem_ge likely gender
file-jjpqk3rctayhvdn19uwgti
. The code likely takes any available user info (if the site provides it via the tag API) and hashes it (the presence of crypto routines like a Buffer polyfill and possibly SHA-256 is suspected, since we saw a large block that looks like a Node.js Buffer implementation
file-jjpqk3rctayhvdn19uwgti
file-jjpqk3rctayhvdn19uwgti
). Indeed, the script defines window.pintrk.version = "3.0" and handles an array of fields matching Pinterest’s Tag documentation for identity data.
Event Tracking: The tag supports various events (page visits, signups, checkouts, etc.). In the code, there are references to event names like "pagevisit" and "checkout"
file-jjpqk3rctayhvdn19uwgti
, and it maps them to certain data payloads. The function pintrk('page') is used to signify a page load, and pintrk('track', 'pagevisit') records a pageview event – the code contains handlers for these commands
file-jjpqk3rctayhvdn19uwgti
file-jjpqk3rctayhvdn19uwgti
. For example, on load it sets up the environment (dropping the iframe, setting cookies), and then when page or other events are fired, it packages up the data to send to Pinterest. It even checks if the current page is a Pinterest Android app WebView (looking for android-app://com.pinterest in the referrer) to handle some integration
file-jjpqk3rctayhvdn19uwgti
.
Purpose: In essence, this is marketing analytics – it allows the site owner to measure how many visitors (or conversions) came from Pinterest ads. If the scammers ran ads on Pinterest or were tracking users via Pinterest’s tag manager, this would feed data to Pinterest’s dashboard. It’s somewhat surprising to see a scam using Pinterest tracking, but it might indicate the scammers were driving traffic via promoted Pins or simply copying a template that had this integration. If they were paying for Pinterest ads, they’d definitely want the tag to know which ad led to a “conversion” (e.g., a user attempting a purchase). It could also be a way to later retarget these users with ads. All of this is normal for e-commerce sites – here it’s just being applied to a fraudulent site. Attribution: The code is maintained by Pinterest, Inc. The structure and domain usage match Pinterest’s official tag as per their developer documentation
stackoverflow.com
stackoverflow.com
. The presence of pinimg.com or ct.pinterest.com is a dead giveaway (Pinterest hosts their tag script at s.pinimg.com/ct/core.js in typical integrations
stackoverflow.com
, and uses ct.pinterest.com for data ingestion). Our file seems to be a self-hosted (or bundled) copy of that core logic – possibly the site merged it into their main bundle for performance. There’s no indication the scammers altered it; it likely still reports to Pinterest’s servers. Threat: The Pinterest tag is not malicious to the user. It will collect metadata about the visit (e.g., referral, page URL, maybe user email if they entered it and the site passed it to the tag API) and send it to Pinterest. The privacy impact is that users may not realize their data is being shared with a third-party (Pinterest) for marketing. For our triage purposes, the main concern is that it’s another beacon sending data out. If investigating this site live, one might want to block or monitor calls to ct.pinterest.com to see what is being sent (e.g., it could include an email hash or order value if the scammers configured those). But from a system-compromise standpoint, this script isn’t trying to exploit the user or steal data for the attacker beyond the marketing context. It could help investigators: for instance, if one gained access to the Pinterest Ads account (through legal means), one might find information on how many victims visited or converted, timestamps, etc. That’s outside the scope of technical analysis, but worth noting as an intel avenue. Sandboxing: Running this code is relatively safe (it won’t harm the analyst’s machine), but it will attempt network calls. So if you want to avoid alerting the scammers or skewing analytics, do intercept the pinterest.com calls. Also note it sets an iframe and cookies – which could persist in a browser environment; use a fresh profile if needed to avoid clutter.
s.js – Sift Science Device Fingerprinting Library
The s.js file is the client JavaScript for Sift Science (now just “Sift”), a fraud detection and risk scoring platform. This is evidenced by the variable names and included components: it declares the global _sift array and uses _sift.push(...) calls, which is exactly how Sift’s integration snippet works
gist.github.com
. Additionally, the file header comments show it includes fingerprintjs2 code
file-nxkqe2trudyrhmixwaqgu3
 and plugin detection for Flash/QuickTime, etc., which are classic techniques used by device fingerprinting libraries circa 2015–2018. Key aspects of s.js:
Global _sift Queue: At the top, it sets var _sift = _sift || [] and defines a callback __siftFlashCB
file-nxkqe2trudyrhmixwaqgu3
. This matches Sift’s documented snippet where the site owner would have already pushed their account keys. For instance, integration docs show: _sift.push(['_setAccount', 'YOUR_BEACON_KEY']); _sift.push(['_trackPageview']); before loading the script
gist.github.com
. In the code, we indeed see handlers for _setAccount, _setUserId, _trackPageview, etc. – the script will iterate through any queued commands and execute them
file-nxkqe2trudyrhmixwaqgu3
. If the scam site included Sift, they likely provided a beacon key (a public key identifying their Sift account) via such a snippet. That key isn’t hard-coded in s.js (it would have been set at runtime by the page).
Device Fingerprinting: The script gathers an extensive array of device and browser attributes. It uses the open-source FingerprintJS2 library (from Valve/Valve’s GitHub, as credited in comments) to get data like installed fonts, Canvas fingerprint, WebGL fingerprint, timezone, language, screen resolution, OS, CPU cores, and so on. It also uses PluginDetect 0.9.1 to check for plugins (Flash, Silverlight, Java, etc.)
file-nxkqe2trudyrhmixwaqgu3
 – this is somewhat dated now (modern browsers have deprecated plugin support), but it shows the intent to collect as many signals as possible. The code likely computes a device ID fingerprint.
Session and User Tracking: Sift’s script will generate its own cookies (sift_browser or similar) to identify the browser. It has functions like _setSessionId and _setUserId which the site can call to correlate the fingerprint with an application-specific user or session. If the user logged in or entered an email, the scammers could push that into Sift via _setUserId. Given the site was a pay-for-service scam, they might not have actual user accounts, but they could still use Sift’s risk scoring on transactions. Sift can tell if a device has been seen before or is high-risk (e.g., associated with chargebacks or known fraud patterns, if the scammer configured it).
Exfiltration to Sift: Importantly, the script sends the collected data to Sift’s servers for analysis. In the code, after compiling the fingerprint information into a query string, it creates a 1x1 pixel image and sets its src to Sift’s collection endpoint
file-nxkqe2trudyrhmixwaqgu3
. We found the base URL defined as F="hexagon-analytics.com"
file-nxkqe2trudyrhmixwaqgu3
, meaning the pixel is requested from https://hexagon-analytics.com/images/<random>.gif?...data.... This domain is known to be used by Sift Science. In fact, Norton’s security blog noted that Sift’s script sends data to hexagon-analytics.com as part of its tracking process
au.norton.com
. (Historically, “Hexagon” was the codename for Sift’s device fingerprinting service, possibly inherited from a company or just an internal project name. It is also associated with Crimson Hexagon/Brandwatch in some tracker databases
ghostery.com
, but in this context it’s unequivocally Sift’s endpoint for fraud analytics.) The image beacon will include the account’s beacon key, the fingerprint hash, and various properties. Sift’s backend then correlates that and gives the site operator a risk score via API.
No inline PII by default: Unless instructed via _sift.push calls, the script by itself doesn’t automatically grab personal info from forms (beyond things like the browser’s IP which the server sees anyway). However, if the site had code to pass email/phone to Sift (using Sift’s JS API _sift.push(['_setUserId', …]) or custom events), those would be sent. We didn’t see those calls in the provided files, but it’s possible they were in the HTML or another inline script.
Purpose: For the scammers, Sift would serve as a fraud defense tool. This is interesting – it suggests the operators were concerned about fraud against themselves (e.g., stolen credit cards or chargebacks) or wanted to blacklist troublesome visitors. Sift could help them identify if a credit card transaction is likely legit by analyzing the device and user behavior in real-time. Many legitimate businesses use Sift to prevent fraud; here the scammers might be using it to ensure they actually get paid or to detect investigators (for instance, if an anti-fraud tool flagged a user as suspicious, they might decline the transaction or require more info). This is a level of sophistication not always seen in scams – it indicates a financially motivated operation that wants to optimize their success rate and avoid losing money to bad credit cards or law enforcement stings. Alternatively, the site owners might have simply copied integration code from some template without fully utilizing it, but given Sift is a paid service, it’s likely intentional. Attribution: Sift Science, Inc. (now just “Sift”) is the author of this script
developers.sift.com
. The code matches their known snippet (which is always named s.js and often served from cdn.sift.com)
developers.sift.com
. All the third-party components (CryptoJS, fingerprintjs2, PluginDetect) are consistent with Sift’s client library circa late-2010s. No malicious group ties here – it’s a commercial anti-fraud product. If needed, the beacon key (if it were known) could identify which Sift customer (which company account) is associated with this script – that would be the scammers’ account and could be a lead for law enforcement. We don’t have that key here, but it might be in the HTML of the site or deducible from network traffic (the beacon request likely contains it as a parameter). Risk: For the end-user, Sift’s presence means extensive tracking. Sift will fingerprint the user’s device in ways that persist beyond just this site (e.g., via evercookie techniques and storing identifiers). Privacy-wise, it’s invasive: Sift might log the user’s email or other info if provided, and the data goes to Sift’s cloud. However, it’s not malware and doesn’t expose the user to compromise. The risk to an analyst is that running this script will “burn” your device fingerprint – it will mark your analysis machine in Sift’s database. If the scammer is actively monitoring their Sift console, they might see multiple attempts or a strange fingerprint (or conversely, if your test card was declined due to Sift, that’s Sift doing its job). So, analysts should run this in a disposable VM and consider spoofing some common fingerprint parameters if trying to blend in. Also, network isolation is wise if you want to prevent data from leaving – though Sift’s beacon is over HTTPS, so you’d need to intercept or block hexagon-analytics.com to stop it.
Attribution Clues
Although these scripts were found on a fraudulent site, each can be tied to a legitimate source or service. This section summarizes who likely wrote or provided each script and any associated organization:
Impact UTT (A3270977-...js): Authored by Impact Tech, Inc. – a company offering affiliate marketing and partnership tracking solutions. All identifiers (cookie names “IR_*”, domain impactcdn.com) and functionality align with Impact’s Universal Tracking Tag
qualitycompanyformations.co.uk
. The inclusion on the scam site indicates the scammers either are affiliates of some program or simply used Impact’s analytics for their own marketing. If an account ID could be extracted (which might be the prefix “A3270977…” or in the Loggly calls), it would point to the account owner (possibly an individual or shell company behind the scam).
Segreencolumn Tracker (c6c44ac6...js): Likely produced by a web analytics or anti-bot provider. We don’t have a brand name, but multiple hints (segreencolumn domain, resemblance to performance monitoring code, overlap with Quantum Metric in traffic captures
joesandbox.com
) suggest a commercial tracking service. One possibility is that it’s a part of BugSnag/FullStory/QuantumMetric or a lesser-known analytics network that uses innocuous domain names. Another possibility is it’s a malicious kit shared among scammers for anti-anti-fraud (though the sophistication and widespread tracker blocking implies a known service). No single threat actor group is directly linked to this code in open sources; instead it appears on any site (good or bad) that has chosen this analytics solution. The use on a scam site could be the scammers leveraging an existing tool to track their “users”.
Lockdown (install/run) Scripts: Written by the Agoric SES project and MetaMask developers. These are open-source. Their presence signals nothing about the scammer except that the analyst or user had MetaMask. It’s not an actor-controlled script on the site, so it doesn’t help attribute the scam to any particular group (aside from indicating the environment of analysis). For completeness: MetaMask is made by Consensys Software Inc., and the SES lockdown library by Agoric (a separate secure computing firm).
Pinterest Tag (main.b4887131.js): Developed and provided by Pinterest as part of their advertising/analytics platform. The specific Tag ID (a numeric tid in the code or calls) could reveal which Pinterest Business account is being used – presumably one controlled by the scammers. That account might be under a fake business name. Pinterest’s team could potentially identify the account owner or at least that it was associated with the fraudulent site. This is a clue outside of the code analysis: the presence of a Pinterest tag means the scammers were possibly paying for Pinterest ads or at least tracking traffic from Pinterest, which is an operational security detail about them.
Sift Science Script (s.js): Created by Sift Science, Inc. The code itself is generic to Sift’s product, but the beacon key configured (not visible in the file but used at runtime) ties to a particular Sift customer. That customer is likely the scam operator or an intermediary. Sift accounts require registration and typically some vetting (since it’s used for payment fraud, etc.), so the scammers either registered under a false identity or compromised someone’s account. If accessible, that key could be given to Sift for investigation – they might be able to identify the client integration or any backend logs of fraud signals.
In summary, none of these scripts appear to be custom-written by the scam authors themselves – they are repurposed commercial tools. The scam’s technical stack thus piggybacks on mainstream services, making attribution to an individual or group more challenging. However, it shows the operators were somewhat sophisticated (using paid services). If law enforcement pursues this case, working with Impact, Pinterest, and Sift to trace account registrations and usage could yield attribution information (e.g., sign-up emails, IP addresses used to access dashboards, payment info for these services, etc.).
Threat Level and Risk Assessment
Overall Threat Level: Moderate. The JavaScript files do not deliver exploits or malware to the client (e.g., no drive-by download, no malicious redirect observed). Therefore, the immediate risk to a user’s device (in terms of getting infected) is low. However, from a privacy and fraud standpoint, the risk is significant. These scripts aggressively harvest data that could be used to fingerprint and track users, potentially even after they leave the site (via persistent identifiers). In the context of a scam, this tracking amplifies the threat to victims’ privacy and could facilitate further abuse (like user profiling or resale of data). Key points per script:
Impact UTT: Low system risk. It sets cookies and monitors conversions. Risk to users: tracking across sites – if multiple sites use the same Impact cookie, a user’s browsing on those sites could be linked. For a victim on this scam site, the Impact script itself doesn’t steal info, but it might report that user’s visit to Impact’s database (including referrer, etc.). It’s conceivable (though unlikely) that Impact’s tracking could inadvertently log some PII if the URL contained query params like email (none noted here). Risk to enterprise: minimal, this is commonly seen on many legit sites. If anything, seeing it on a supposed “background check” site might lend false legitimacy to the victim (“they have enterprise tracking, so maybe it’s a real service”).
Segreencolumn Tracker: Elevated risk due to fingerprinting. This script is essentially a surveillance tool in the browser. It doesn’t attempt privilege escalation, but it will extract a lot of device info. That info (user agent, screen size, canvas fingerprint, etc.) can be used to identify the user uniquely on return visits or across different sites using the same tracker. If the scammers (or the service provider) wanted, they could potentially link the victim’s browsing to other data or even attempt browser unmasking techniques. For security teams, any custom fingerprinting like this raises a flag: if such a script is found on corporate assets or unusual pages, it could indicate an attempted tracking or an implant. Here it’s third-party, but note that an attacker could also use this technique to gather intel on visitors (e.g., collecting a list of installed plugins might help target a follow-up exploit if an outdated plugin is found). Sandboxing is strongly advised for analysis, as mentioned. Also, there’s a small risk that this code could interfere with browser performance or stability (due to heavy operations), which could be a factor if it were on many pages.
Lockdown (MetaMask SES): No malicious risk. If anything, this reduces the risk of other scripts doing bad things. For triage, it’s noise. You might consider it a “false positive” if your threat detection flagged the word “lockdown” or some unusual function hooking (since it does override lots of globals). But once identified, it should be whitelisted as benign. The only scenario where lockdown.js could be a threat is if a malicious site tries to detect MetaMask (by looking for these artifacts) to, say, target MetaMask users specifically. But here it’s the extension injecting it, not the site.
Pinterest Tag: Low direct risk. It’s a known analytics script from a major platform. It will siphon off marketing data to Pinterest, but this is data the scammers themselves likely provided (campaign IDs, etc.) plus possibly hashed PII if configured. To the user, the tag doesn’t compromise anything locally. One could consider it a privacy risk – e.g., if the user is logged into Pinterest, Pinterest might know they visited this scam page and use that in their ad profiles (not great for the user, but also not a security breach per se). From a fraud perspective, this tag might help the scammers retarget victims with ads (“reminding” them to come back and complete a purchase). That could increase the scam’s effectiveness. But the code itself won’t harm the user’s machine.
Sift Science (s.js): Moderate risk. This is similar to the segreencolumn tracker in that it deeply fingerprints the user. Sift, as a company, keeps this info to provide a fraud score to its client (the scammer). The data (device prints, IP, geolocation, behavioral signals) going to Sift could theoretically be accessed by the scammer via Sift’s dashboard or APIs. That means any info Sift can infer (like “this device has done 3 chargebacks in the past month on other sites” if those sites also use Sift) might indirectly aid the scammer. It’s a one-way street: Sift is unlikely to share info from the scammer to others, but it will inform the scammer if a user is “high risk.” For the user, being flagged might mean the scammer cancels their transaction – in some cases, that could be a good thing (fraud attempt blocked), but it could also mean the scammer avoids wasting time on a user who might not pay. In any event, Sift tracking on a malicious site is not going to hack the user; it’s all about data collection and analysis. From a defender viewpoint, seeing Sift’s script on a page that shouldn’t have it (e.g., internal site or unexpected context) could indicate someone is trying to instrument your users/devices. But in most cases, Sift appears on legitimate e-commerce/fintech pages.
In summary, these scripts are part of the scam’s support infrastructure rather than the attack payload. The primary danger is the loss of privacy and the potential for profiling. There’s also a secondary concern: if any of these third-party scripts were compromised (supply-chain attack on Impact, Pinterest, Sift, etc.), then a malicious actor could inject truly harmful code via them. That’s a generic risk with any external script. In our analysis, we did not see signs of such compromise – each script’s behavior matched its legitimate purpose. But it’s worth noting in a risk assessment: a scam site loading 5 different third-party scripts increases the attack surface (any one of those services getting breached could escalate the situation). For the fraud investigators, the presence of these scripts means additional data streams to investigate (and possibly leverage). For the victims, it means their visit was tracked by multiple entities (the scammers and these analytics companies).
Known Infrastructure and Reporting Destinations
During analysis, we identified the following domains and endpoints that these scripts communicate with. These should be considered indicators of interest/concern. Security teams may use these IOCs to monitor network traffic or block connections, with the understanding that some are also used by legitimate sites (so apply context accordingly):
logs-01.loggly.com – Loggly cloud logging endpoint used by the Impact script. Specifically, logs are sent to an “inputs” URL with the token 9b965af4-52fb-46fa-be1b-8dc5fb0aad05 and tag jsinsight. This token appears unique to this site’s Impact integration (or Impact’s client code)
file-4u6gqrpnzfn2udwvdj97dg
. Any network traffic containing that GUID is a strong indicator of this specific site’s script in action. (Loggly is a legitimate service, but that token is an IOC).
utt.impactcdn.com – Impact’s CDN domain for the Universal Tracking Tag. In this case, the script was likely originally loaded from an URL containing the account’s UUID (the file name) under this domain. It also sets cookies on this domain (e.g., IR_gbd)
weber.com
. If observed in traffic or cookie storage, it indicates Impact tracking. Blocking impactcdn.com would stop Impact tracking (but note: many normal businesses use it).
obs.segreencolumn.com (and related subdomains like ob.segreencolumn.com, euob.segreencolumn.com) – The primary telemetry ingestion point for the segreencolumn tracker
file-vivbfbn87f69m5dznczvn4
. It receives the GIF and HTML tracker requests and the ct data payloads. These subdomains resolve to Amazon AWS infrastructure (CloudFront/Amazon domains in our lookup). They have appeared in multiple sandbox reports associated with potentially unwanted tracking
any.run
. Unless your organization explicitly uses a service that requires this domain, any traffic to it is suspicious. In the context of the scam site, all user interactions would generate requests to this domain. We recommend treating this domain as untrusted. Security tools (like Cisco Umbrella, adblock filters) already rank or block it as a tracker
urlscan.io
.
segreencolumn.com – The root domain itself wasn’t directly contacted by the script (it specifically uses subdomains), but any DNS queries or TLS handshakes for *.segreencolumn.com are part of this tracking. Include it in threat intel searches (e.g., to find other sites that have used the same tracker, you could search DNS logs for segreencolumn lookups).
ct.pinterest.com – Pinterest’s conversion tracking API endpoint. The script uses ct.pinterest.com/v3/?tid=<tag_id>&... for pixel and event submissions
stackoverflow.com
. This domain is owned by Pinterest and also used broadly by their analytics across many sites. Its presence is not inherently malicious (it will appear for any site with Pinterest Tag). However, if you are scoping a compromise specific to this scam site, you might capture occurrences of the specific Tag ID (a 13-digit number in the URL parameters) to identify related traffic. Blocking ct.pinterest.com will neutralize the Pinterest tag’s data exfiltration (though note, Pinterest shares the pinimg.com CDN for the tag script and might use the same domain for other resources).
s.pinimg.com – Pinterest’s CDN domain that typically serves the tag script (core.js). In our case, the script was embedded, but if you see calls to s.pinimg.com/ct/core.js or similar, that’s the Pinterest tag being loaded. This domain is generally benign (just JavaScript content).
cdn.sift.com – Sift’s CDN from which s.js is usually loaded
developers.sift.com
. In our data, we have the file itself, but originally the site likely pulled it from https://cdn.sift.com/s.js. Connections to this domain would indicate the Sift snippet being fetched. It’s a legitimate domain but could be an IOC if you know Sift isn’t used elsewhere in your environment.
hexagon-analytics.com – Sift Science’s data collection domain (also possibly known from Crimson Hexagon/Brandwatch contexts)
ghostery.com
. The Sift script sends a GET request to https://hexagon-analytics.com/images/<random>.gif?<fingerprint_data> as its beacon
file-nxkqe2trudyrhmixwaqgu3
. This domain is a critical IOC: outside of Sift’s functionality, you generally wouldn’t expect random sites to contact it. If you see traffic to hexagon-analytics.com (especially an “images/*.gif” pattern with long query strings), it likely means a device fingerprint was just sent. In our scenario, that indicates a user interacted with the scam site. Note that hexagon-analytics.com is also used by Brandwatch analytics, so one should corroborate context (e.g., look at the user agent and referer of the request). In any case, it’s an uncommon domain to see in normal traffic, so it merits scrutiny.
Miscellaneous:
IP addresses: The domains above resolve to various cloud IPs. For instance, at the time of sandboxing, ob.segreencolumn.com resolved to AWS IP 18.238.80.12 (us-west-2)
joesandbox.com
 and obs.segreencolumn.com to 54.83.110.109 (us-east-1)
joesandbox.com
. hexagon-analytics.com has been seen resolving to Google Cloud IPs (34.102.249.210, etc.)
joesandbox.com
. These could change due to CDN usage. It’s more reliable to use domain indicators rather than hardcoding IPs, but for completeness you might watch for those IPs if domain info is unavailable.
Cookies: The presence of certain cookies can indicate these scripts ran. For example, an IR_PI or IR_gbd cookie on a user’s browser indicates the Impact tag set a tracker
weber.com
. Sift’s script might set a cookie like sift_xxxxx (often it uses a browser ID cookie). And Pinterest’s tag may use first-party cookies or localStorage to store a Pinterest ID for attribution. If investigating a user’s device, finding those cookies with timestamps aligning to the incident could be evidence of the scripts’ activity.
In summary, the infrastructure associated with these scripts is mostly marketing/fraud analytics infrastructure. In a vacuum, connections to them aren’t conclusive of wrongdoing (since many sites use them), but in context (a user hitting a supposed background-check site), seeing all these third-party calls is a red flag. If you suspect a site is malicious and you see it reaching out to such endpoints, it suggests the site is instrumented heavily — a sign of a professional or commercial operation rather than a run-of-the-mill phishing page.
Recommendations
Given the analysis, we recommend the following actions for security professionals dealing with these files or the site in question:
Isolate and Sandbox for Analysis: If you need to execute or further study these scripts, do so in a controlled sandbox environment (such as a VM with network monitoring and no sensitive data). These scripts will immediately beacon out to external servers and drop tracking cookies; containing that prevents leakage of any analyst or environment identifiers. Tools like Any.Run or Hybrid Analysis can be used to safely execute the scripts – indeed, such services have flagged the segreencolumn and Sift beacons in past analyses
any.run
au.norton.com
. Leverage those platforms to observe network patterns without risking your local network.
Network Blocking/Filtering: For enterprise defense, consider blocking or flagging traffic to the domains identified (especially segreencolumn.com and hexagon-analytics.com). These have little legitimate use in most corporate web traffic. Blocking them will not disrupt common business applications in the majority of cases, but will neuter a lot of web tracking/fingerprinting. If outright blocking is not feasible, set up IDS/monitoring rules to alert on these domains. For instance, a Snort/Suricata rule could watch for Host: obs.segreencolumn.com in HTTP traffic. Similarly, monitor DNS queries for those domains. An alert could signify an employee visited the scam site (or another site using the same tracker), which might warrant a security response.
Script Hashes and Signatures: Calculate hashes (e.g., SHA-256) of these JavaScript files and add them to your threat intelligence feeds. While the specific hash of a bundled file might not recur exactly on another site, components might. For example, the Sift s.js hash will be common across any site using that exact version. The Impact tag file’s hash is unique to the account, but if you find that same hash on another system or artifact, it’s likely related to the same scammer’s web properties. Use tools like VirusTotal to see if these hashes were uploaded by others, which can pivot to discover forums or analysis notes. (Currently, VT might have hits for segments of the code – e.g., searching for the Loggly token or the segreencolumn URLs shows some malware reports – you can use that to find if these scripts appeared in other investigations
joesandbox.com
.)
Engage Threat Intel/Providers: Given that multiple well-known services are involved (Impact, Pinterest, Sift), you might consider contacting them:
Impact: Report the usage of their tag by a fraudulent site. Provide the script’s GUID name or the Loggly token. Impact has a fraud/security team (as it handles affiliate abuse often) and might disable the account or give insight into who registered it. This can cut off the scammers from tracking new victims and possibly reveal their identity (if they used real details to sign up for payouts).
Pinterest: Likewise, notify Pinterest that their tag ID (if known) is linked to a scam. Pinterest might shut down any ad campaigns or accounts related to that tag. They have an interest in not paying out ad revenue to scammers or letting scams propagate via their platform.
Sift: Inform Sift that their service is being used by a known fraudulent site. Sift takes abuse seriously since their system is meant to fight fraud, not abet it. They could investigate the account tied to that beacon key, and potentially ban it or cooperate in an investigation. Sift’s console would also contain device/browser hashes of victims – which could be useful evidence if law enforcement subpoenas it.
Engaging these companies can increase pressure on the scammer (loss of analytics and tools) and possibly yield identifying information, as mentioned in Attribution.
Web Content Filtering for Users: If you support users who might visit scams, enabling aggressive privacy/content blocking can mitigate harm. For example, browser extensions or DNS filters that block “known trackers” would have blocked segreencolumn and hexagon-analytics by default (these appear on blocklists
gist.github.com
ghostery.com
). This doesn’t stop the scam entirely but reduces what the scammer can learn about the user’s environment. It could also prevent certain tricks (like if the segreencolumn script were used to detect headless browsers or VMs, blocking it might allow an analyst to slip by detection). Thus, encouraging use of Privacy Badger, uBlock Origin, etc., can indirectly foil some aspects of such scams.
Examine User Device for Artifacts: If you have a victim’s machine available, check their browser for artifacts of these scripts. Look at local storage (for any keys related to these domains), cookies (IR_ cookies, Pinterest _epik or _pinterest_sess cookies, Sift cookies usually named sift_browser or similar), and browser history for calls to the domains. This can confirm the user’s interaction with the scam and possibly timestamp it. Be mindful that cookies like IR_PI might persist and could be read by other sites that use Impact – consider clearing them to avoid cross-site correlation.
Education and Policy: Recognize that scammers are using sophisticated third-party services – this blurs the line between “legitimate web tech” and “malicious behavior.” Security training for analysts should include awareness that not everything using ad-tech or analytics is benign in context. Conversely, the presence of these services on a site that shouldn’t have them is a red flag. Develop playbooks for investigating suspicious sites that include checking for excessive tracking scripts. A small honest business might use Google Analytics, but a fake business using five different trackers (Impact, Pinterest, Sift, etc.) is unusual and should increase suspicion.
Future Scanning: Incorporate these findings into automated scanners. For instance, if crawling the web for scam sites, flag any page that loads s.js (Sift) or references impactcdn.com outside of known contexts. Those are often invisible to normal users but a scanner looking at network calls or script content can catch them. This can help discover other fraudulent sites run by the same group (they might reuse their Impact ID or Sift key on multiple scam domains). Indeed, by searching the web for the specific Loggly token or the Impact script ID, you might find other domains embedding the same script
meh.com
. That’s a pivot for threat hunting.
Containment: If this analysis is in response to an incident (e.g., an employee attempted to purchase on the scam site), ensure to block the payment (contact the credit card provider) because the scam likely aims to steal money. While outside the scope of these scripts, the presence of anti-fraud measures like Sift implies the scammers anticipated chargebacks – so follow through on those protections: the victim should dispute any charges and watch for identity misuse. The technical scripts here won’t steal credentials or install malware, but the bigger threat is the scam itself (monetary loss). So, treat the technical findings as complementary to the fraud investigation.
In conclusion, these scripts should be handled with the same care as malware during analysis (to avoid tipping off the adversary or exposing data), even though their function is “telemetry.” By instrumenting the browser, the adversaries have created a passive recon threat. Cutting off their telemetry, gleaning intel from it, and using it to map out the scam’s infrastructure will improve your chances of shutting down the operation and protecting users. Always balance the necessity of gathering more information (by letting the scripts run or querying the services) with the operational security concerns (alerting the scammer or contaminating evidence).
