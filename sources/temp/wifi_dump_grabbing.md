WiFiDump – Recovering WiFi Passwords On Windows
Sep 26th, 2012 by carrumba

Tool name :	WiFiDump
 
Description :	WiFiDump is a tool to recover all locally stored WiFi account information. It loops through a WiFi profile catalogue and extracts all the relevant profile information. WiFiDump first has to decrypt the password before printing it because Windows keeps sensitive information encrypted.
To run WiFiDump properly you need administrator privileges.

 
Tested on :	Windows 7
 
Feedback :	In case you encounter any problems with the tool, you have suggestions to improve it, or you tested it with a Windows version I’ve not yet tested please drop me an email.
